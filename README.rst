DotFiles
========

* This repository contains dotfiles such as .zshrc, .tmux.conf, etc. The idea is to clone this repo on any new machine and create a symlink to these files. This will ensure that these softwares would work the same way across the systems.

* We also assume that the required softwares such as nvim (>0.5) and tmux are preinstalled on the machine.

* Take a look at similar `dotfiles repositories <https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles>`_
